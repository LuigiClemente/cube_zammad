### 1. Establishing Relationships:

In your PostgreSQL database, each user from Zammad is intricately connected to distinct tables, such as `alimento`, `analise`, `refeicao`, and `usuario`. These relationships are integral, and each `usuario` entry serves as a pivotal point, linking to specific records in the associated tables.

```sql
-- For User table
ALTER TABLE usuario
ADD FOREIGN KEY (id_alimento) REFERENCES alimento(id),
ADD FOREIGN KEY (id_refeicao) REFERENCES refeicao(id);
```

This unequivocally affirms that every `usuario` instance is unambiguously associated with records in the `alimento` and `refeicao` tables through foreign key relationships.

### 2. Data Security Measures:

Implementing robust security measures is imperative to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Row-Level Security (RLS) plays a pivotal role, allowing access to specific rows based on predefined conditions. The following exemplifies a security policy specifically tailored for the `usuario` table:

```sql
CREATE POLICY usuario_policy
    ON usuario
    USING (id = current_user);
```

This irrefutably establishes that only the user whose `id` corresponds to the `current_user` is authorized to access their associated rows in the `usuario` table.

### 3. TypeScript Implementation:

In the TypeScript implementation, a Node.js server, driven by Express and the `pg` library, solidifies the integration between your frontend and the PostgreSQL database. The code snippet below exemplifies the assertive TypeScript implementation:

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'your_user',
  host: 'your_host',
  database: 'your_database',
  password: 'your_password',
  port: 5432,
});

app.use(express.json());

app.get('/api/user-data', async (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.user.id; // Assume user information is included in the request

  try {
    // Fetch user-specific data
    const userData = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM usuario WHERE id = $1', [userId]);

    res.json(userData.rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
